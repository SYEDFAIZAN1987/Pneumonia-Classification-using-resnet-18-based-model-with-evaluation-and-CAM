# Pneumonia-Classification-using-resnet-18-based-model-with-evaluation-and-CAM
In this project I created a convolutional Neural Network based on resnet 18 to classify Pneumonia on X-Rays from the RSNA Dataset. Evaluation was carried out with high accuracy and Recall in the weighted model. CAM was implemented to see the area of the X Ray contributing most to the predictive power of the Model.
